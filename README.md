# docker-systemd
This role creates systemd unit files for Docker containers.

## Requirements
The target host needs to be running systemd and needs to have Docker installed.

## Role Variables

### Required Variables
* `name` *string* - the name for the container. This is used in a number of
  places, including the container name, the service file name, and the
  description.
* `Ã¬mage` *string* - the image to run.

### Optional Variables
* `description` *string* - the unit description; some tools display this as a
  friendly name for the unit.
* `pull_image` *boolean* - if true, pull the image before starting the
  service. Defaults to true.
* `recreate_container` *boolean* - if true, the container is deleted when the
  service is stopped and recreated when it is restarted. Defaults to true.
* `cmd` *string* - the command to pass to `docker run`. Defaults to an empty
  string, meaning the default command specified in the image is used.

  extension.

  `--link` flag to `docker run`.

      ports:
